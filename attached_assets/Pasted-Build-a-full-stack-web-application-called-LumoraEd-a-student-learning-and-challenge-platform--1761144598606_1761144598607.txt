Build a full-stack web application called LumoraEd — a student learning and challenge platform.

🔹 OVERVIEW:
LumoraEd helps students achieve academic and career skill goals through structured challenges (like “50 Days of Python”). 
Students can complete daily tasks, take quizzes, track progress, and get free certification alerts.
Admins can create challenges and view student analytics.

🔹 TECH STACK:
Frontend: React + TailwindCSS
Backend: Node.js + Express.js
Database: Neon Cloud PostgreSQL
Authentication: Firebase Auth
Hosting: Replit

🔹 CORE FEATURES:
1. User Authentication using Firebase (Google & Email login)
2. Challenge Management (create, edit, delete challenges)
3. Daily Tasks with resources (links, PDFs, videos)
4. Quizzes for learning validation
5. Progress tracking (completion %, daily streaks, performance charts)
6. Free certification alerts (admin adds, students view)

🔹 DATABASE (Neon PostgreSQL Tables):
- users(id, name, email, role)
- challenges(id, title, description, duration, created_by)
- tasks(id, challenge_id, day_number, title, content, resource_links)
- submissions(id, user_id, task_id, status, score)
- certifications(id, title, provider, link, date_added)

🔹 BACKEND:
- Node.js + Express API
- Connect Neon PostgreSQL using connection string in .env
- Handle routes: /auth, /challenges, /tasks, /progress, /certifications
- Use JWT or Firebase tokens for protected routes

🔹 FRONTEND:
- React with TailwindCSS
- Firebase Auth integration
- Pages:
  • Home
  • Challenges List
  • Daily Task View
  • Quiz Page
  • Dashboard (Progress Graphs, Active Challenges)
  • Certification Alerts
- Use Axios for API calls
- Use Chart.js or Recharts for progress visualization

🔹 UI EXPECTATIONS:
- Clean, minimal, responsive dashboard design
- Sidebar for navigation (Challenges | Dashboard | Alerts)
- Display progress stats, challenge streaks, and daily goals

🔹 STRETCH GOALS:
- Add leaderboard based on quiz scores or completion rate
- Notification reminders for daily tasks
- Markdown support for challenge descriptions

🔹 GOAL:
Enable students to track, learn, and grow consistently through daily learning challenges and analytics.
